# HI3-MA-Discord-Bot

Have you even needed to check the time for Memorial Arena to see if the second is jumped but doesnt have a list of timing lying around?  

This Discord bot will allow you to do that. Just do a simple &time command and the UP and non-UP score will be displayed for you.

> Features
- Check MA time against score
- Message reaction
- Abyss reminder
- Score list (soon)
